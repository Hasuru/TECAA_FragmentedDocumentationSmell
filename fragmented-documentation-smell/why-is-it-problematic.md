# Why is it problematic

The Fragmented Documentation Smell, as mentioned in the previous page [What is the Fragmented Documentation Smell](what-is-the-fragmented-documentation-smell.md), this smell appeals to organization and read flow problems within documentation.&#x20;

Organization and readability are essential components needed in documentation[\[1\]](references.md). Good organization and read flow can make the life of those using the documentation easier, since good structured documentation exposes its information in a logical order and in turn, facilitates content search throughout the whole document. Another amazing perk of maintaining a good documentation structure is that maintaining said documentation becomes more logical and fluid for the authors.

All developers eventually fall prey to bad organization, even in their own private documentation. Even though these kinds of organizational principles come with along with write experience, having a tool that helps developers judged their organizational capabilities and adjust their documentation to something more efficient and digestible is always welcomed, since documentation of the APIs often is considered a "post-development issue" and developers tend to jump bridges in the standards of documentation, often leaving the documentation incomplete and unorganized. This clearly can cause other developers who wish to use the API some trouble, mainly finding the necessary information in a fast and complete way.&#x20;
