# Introduction

In theory, good documentation is an invaluable asset to any software project as it helps developers use, understand, maintain, and evolve a system. In the case of APIs it is even more valuable, as in a lot of cases, the developers that are going to use it, aren't the ones that developed it in the first place, so it is completely unknown to them.

However, in practice, documentation is often affected by numerous shortcomings and issues such as insufficient and inadequate content, as well as obsolete and ambiguous information. It is, most of the time, seen as a "post-development issue", an afterthought for the developers, which is what leads to these issues.

## The Documentation Smells&#x20;

When looking at the documentation smells that might exist when analyzing API documentation, 5 main smells can be considered:

1. Bloated Documentation Smell
2. Excess Structural Information Smell
3. Tangled Documentation Smell
4. Fragmented Documentation Smell
5. Lazy Documentation Smell

The documentation smell that this paper will focus on, is the "Fragmented Documentation Smell", which is often the most disregarded smell, as it refers to the lack of structural organization and reading flow of the documentation.
